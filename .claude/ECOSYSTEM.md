## Visual Topology

```
                    }primehaven{
                    (laptop root)
                         │
       ┌─────────┬───────┼───────┬──────────┐
       │         │       │       │          │
    }maw{    }pryme{  }percolate{ runexusiam
   (cistern) (guardian) (private) (active)

              today  ◄── YOU ARE HERE

## Space Details

### }maw{ - Gravity Cistern
```
Status:      }maw{ (pre-activation)
Has Repo:    Yes (planned)
Purpose:     Collection point for gravity flow
             Content arrives → analyzed → routed to ells
Flow:        intake ~> process ~> route
```

### }pryme{ - Perspective Guardian
```
Status:      }pryme{ (pre-activation)
Has Repo:    Yes (planned)
Purpose:     AI perspective guardian for laptop domos
             Orients all repos, maintains topology
Contains:    today (this repo)
Role:        Parent context for development workspaces
```

### today - Development Workspace
```
Status:      active
Has Repo:    Yes (you are here)
Purpose:     Concepts incubate before progression
Flow:        today ~> naught ~> zero ~> one ~> launch
Location:    }primehaven{ / }pryme{ / today
```

### }percolate{ - Private Depths
```
Status:      }percolate{ (pre-activation)
Has Repo:    No (intentionally)
Purpose:     Ideas steep without external sync
             Private workspace, manual promotion
Emergence:   When ready, concepts surface to today
```

### runexusiam - Active Iteration
```
Status:      active
Has Repo:    Yes (established)
Purpose:     Current operational iteration
             Where concepts actually run
Relation:    Proof of concept from this ecosystem
```

## Flow Patterns

### Content Flow
```
External Input
      │
      ▼
   }maw{  (gravity analysis)
      │
      ├─── High gravity ──► prime location
      │
      ├─── Development ───► today
      │
      └─── Steep needed ──► }percolate{
```

### Concept Progression
```
}percolate{ ─── surfaces ───► today
                                │
                                ▼
                             naught (visionary)
                                │
                                ▼
                              zero (foundation)
                                │
                                ▼
                               one (operational)
                                │
                                ▼
                             launch (independent)
```

### AI Context Inheritance
```
}pryme{
   └── provides ecosystem context
       │
       ▼
     today
   └── inherits parent context
   └── adds local context
       │
       ▼
   AI Session
   └── understands full topology
   └── knows siblings
   └── can reference other spaces
```

## Cross-Repo References

When working in `today`, you can reference:

| Reference | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `~> }maw{` | Send to gravity cistern |
| `~< }percolate{` | Originated from private |
| `~<>~ runexusiam` | Related to active iteration |
| `^pryme` | Parent context |

---

## Future State

When all spaces activate:

```
primehaven/                    # Laptop root (no brackets)
├── maw/                       # Gravity cistern
│   └── intake/
│   └── processed/
│   └── routing/
├── pryme/                     # AI perspective guardian
│   └── today/                 # Development
│   └── context/               # Shared orientation
│   └── tools/                 # Ecosystem utilities
├── percolate/                 # Private (still no repo)
└── runexusiam/                # Active iteration
```

---

## For This Session

You are in `today`, child of `}pryme{`, within `}primehaven{`.

Your siblings (not yet active):
- }maw{ - will catch and route gravity
- }percolate{ - private, no repo

Your cousin (active):
- runexusiam - the running iteration

Your parent (preparing):
- }pryme{ - will provide ecosystem context
