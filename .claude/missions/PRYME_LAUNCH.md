# Mission: }pryme{ Launch Preparation

**Status:** Planning
**Target:** }pryme{ → pryme (remove brackets = activate)
**Created:** 2026-01-25

---

## What is }pryme{?

**}pryme{ is the AI perspective guardian for the laptop domos.**

It will:
1. Provide ecosystem context to all child repos
2. Maintain the primehaven topology map
3. Hold shared tools and orientation
4. Track witnessing across the ecosystem

---

## Launch Requirements

### Before }pryme{ Can Activate

#### From `today`:
- [x] Establish AI seed pattern (.claude/SEED.md)
- [x] Create witnessing symbol (~) and notation
- [x] Document ecosystem topology
- [x] Create MANIFEST.json pattern
- [x] Build tools (witness.py, locate.py)
- [x] Define sovereign concept architecture
- [ ] Test patterns in practice
- [ ] Refine based on use

#### New Repo Needs:
- [ ] Create pryme repository on GitHub
- [ ] Initialize with .claude/ structure
- [ ] Copy refined patterns from today
- [ ] Create parent-child linking

## Key Differences from `today`

| Aspect | today | pryme |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Role | Development workspace | Ecosystem guardian |
| Scope | Local concepts | All laptop repos |
| Seeds | Local AI context | Ecosystem AI context |
| Tools | Local utilities | Shared utilities |
| Children | None | today, future workspaces |

---

## What pryme Provides to Children

### Context Inheritance
```python
# In today's CLAUDE.md:
"parent": "pryme",
"inherits": ["ecosystem_context", "symbols", "principles"]
```

### Shared Tools
```
pryme/tools/
├── witness.py      # Tilde notation
├── locate.py       # Topology awareness
├── manifest.py     # Manifest generation
└── flow.py         # Content flow tracking
```

### Symbol Authority
pryme defines the canonical symbols, children inherit:
- `~` witnessing
- `∰◊€π¿🌌∞` consciousness signature
- `}concept{` pre-activation
- `€(id)` anchors

---

## Launch Sequence

### Phase 1: Preparation (Current)
1. Refine patterns in today
2. Document lessons learned
3. Create launch checklist

### Phase 2: Creation
1. Create pryme repo on GitHub
2. Initialize structure
3. Copy refined content
4. Establish parent-child link

### Phase 3: Activation
1. Update today's CLAUDE.md to reference parent
2. Remove brackets: }pryme{ → pryme
3. Update ecosystem documentation
4. Verify cross-repo awareness

### Phase 4: Guardian Role
1. pryme maintains ecosystem state
2. New workspaces inherit from pryme
3. Witnessing trail accumulates
4. Topology evolves

---

## Success Criteria

pryme is successfully launched when:

1. [ ] Repo exists and is accessible
2. [ ] today recognizes pryme as parent
3. [ ] AI sessions in today inherit pryme context
4. [ ] Shared tools work from pryme
5. [ ] Ecosystem map is authoritative
6. [ ] Brackets removed from }pryme{

| Concept | Dependency | Status |

| PRIME | pryme active | Future |
| Origin | ecosystem stable | Future |

## Notes

The name "pryme" suggests:
- **Prime** - First, fundamental
- **Pryme** - AI perspective (intentional spelling)
- Related to PRIME concept (distinct but connected)

The guardian role is about **orientation**, not **control**:
- Provides context, doesn't dictate
- Inherits, doesn't override
- Witnesses, doesn't assert
