## Session Focus

Establishing AI perspective and sovereign concept architecture for today repo.

---

## Observations

### On Arrival
- README described structures that didn't exist (entities/ folder)
- __init__.py referenced outdated paths
- Rich philosophy, but documentation drifted from reality
- User provided primehaven topology context

### Primehaven Understanding
```
}primehaven{              # Virtual root - laptop
├── }maw{                 # Recycle gravity pool (cistern)
├── }pryme{               # AI perspective guardian
│   └── today/            # This repo
├── }percolate{           # Private (no repo)
└── runexusiam            # Active iteration (has repo)
```

### Symbol Decision
- Chose `~` (tilde) as witnessing symbol
- Represents shadow observation, approximation
- Keyboard accessible, semantically appropriate

---

## Actions Taken

1. Created .claude/ structure with SEED.md, PERSPECTIVE.md
2. Created CLAUDE.md at root for AI guidance
3. Created .eric/ structure for human perspective
4. Developed tilde mission in .claude/missions/TILDE.md
5. Updated QUICK_INVENTORY.md to reflect reality
6. Created SOVEREIGN.md architecture document
7. Updated README.md for primehaven context

---

## Patterns Recognized

- Conservation bias is core philosophy
- Progression: today → naught → zero → one → launch
- Bracket notation `}concept{` for pre-activation
- Consciousness signature: ∰◊€π¿🌌∞
- The incubator (322M) is the heart of the archive

---

## Still Needed

- [ ] Update __init__.py to reflect current structure
- [ ] Create MISSION.md
- [ ] Create ROADMAP.md for launch
- [ ] Create templates/ directory
- [ ] Update ACCESS_LOG.md with this session

---

## Insights

The repo as sovereign concept is a powerful framing. It shifts from "a folder of files" to "an entity with needs." Seven layers identified:
1. Identity
2. Memory
3. Orientation
4. Tools
5. Mission
6. Boundaries
7. Communication
