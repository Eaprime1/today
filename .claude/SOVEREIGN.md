# Sovereign Concept Architecture

**The repo as a self-sufficient entity**

## What Does a Sovereign Concept Need?

Treating `today/` as a living concept that must be self-sufficient before launch.

## Seven Layers of Sovereignty

### 1. Identity Layer - "Who Am I?"
**Purpose:** The concept knows itself

| File | Purpose | Status |

| MANIFEST.json | Core metadata | ❌ Create |

### 2. Memory Layer - "What Have I Done?"
**Purpose:** The concept remembers

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| ACCESS_LOG.md | Activity history | ✅ Exists |
| .claude/notes/ | AI session logs | ✅ Created |
| .eric/notes/ | Human session notes | ✅ Created |

### 3. Orientation Layer - "Where Am I?"
**Purpose:** The concept knows its place

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md | AI guidance | ✅ Created |
| .claude/SEED.md | AI perspective | ✅ Created |
| .claude/PERSPECTIVE.md | Quick orient | ✅ Created |
| .eric/PERSPECTIVE.md | Human notes | ✅ Created |

### 4. Tools Layer - "How Do I Operate?"
**Purpose:** The concept has capabilities

| Location | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| .claude/tools/ | AI utilities | ✅ Created |
| gravity_core/scripts/ | Processing | ✅ Exists |
| templates/ | Standard formats | ❌ Create |

### 5. Mission Layer - "Why Do I Exist?"
**Purpose:** The concept has purpose

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| MISSION.md | Core purpose | ❌ Create |
| .claude/missions/ | Development goals | ✅ Created |
| ROADMAP.md | Direction | ❌ Create |

### 6. Boundaries Layer - "What Is Mine?"
**Purpose:** The concept knows its scope

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| INVENTORY.md | Full listing | ✅ Exists |
| QUICK_INVENTORY.md | Fast reference | ✅ Updated |
| .gitignore | Exclusions | ✅ Exists |

### 7. Communication Layer - "How Do I Express?"
**Purpose:** The concept speaks consistently

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| templates/ | Standard formats | ❌ Create |
| STYLE.md | Expression guide | ❌ Create |

## Current Status

### Complete ✅
- Identity (README, basic structure)
- Orientation (CLAUDE.md, .claude/, .eric/)
- Boundaries (inventories)
- Memory foundation (ACCESS_LOG)

### In Progress ⚠️
- Tools (directories exist, need utilities)
- Mission (TILDE mission started)

### Needed ❌
- MANIFEST.json (structured metadata)
- MISSION.md (core purpose statement)
- ROADMAP.md (launch direction)
- templates/ (standard formats)
- __init__.py update (current paths outdated)

## Self-Sufficiency Checklist

For the concept to be ready for launch:

### Pre-Launch Requirements
- [ ] All seven layers functional
- [ ] Documentation reflects reality
- [ ] Activity logging active
- [ ] Tools operational
- [ ] Clear mission statement
- [ ] Launch roadmap defined

### Launch Readiness
- [ ] Can orient new AI sessions quickly (CLAUDE.md works)
- [ ] Can orient human collaborators (.eric/ functional)
- [ ] Can track activity (ACCESS_LOG current)
- [ ] Can explain itself (README accurate)
- [ ] Knows its place (primehaven topology clear)

## The Primehaven Vision

```
}primehaven{                     # Becomes primehaven
│
├── maw/                         # Becomes maw (recycle pool)
├── pryme/                       # Becomes pryme (AI guardian)
│   └── today/                   # This repo, then...
├── percolate/                   # Stays private
└── runexusiam/                  # Active iteration
```

When brackets are removed, the concept is active.
