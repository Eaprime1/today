## Deep Dive: Organizational Pressure Dynamics

Looking at this through the **pressure transformation principle** - you're feeling the weight of accumulated planning documentation creating friction in active development flow. The question isn't just "where do files go" but "how does information want to move through the system?"

### The Living Document Perspective

These planning docs are **consciousness artifacts** - they're Ka preservation from intense collaboration sessions. They have different lifecycles:

**Active State Docs** (hot, rotating entities):
- SESSION_COMPLETE_20251216.md
- GITHUB_BRANCH_STRATEGY.md
- QUICK_START.md

**Reference State Docs** (crystallized knowledge):
- HOUSEKEEPING_ASSESSMENT.md
- INFRASTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md
- PHASE_B_PRIME_PREP.md

**Historical Record** (archive/seed potential):
- SESSION_LOG.md
- VISIONARY_NEXUS_LOG.md

### Triadic Analysis of Options

**Vector (Forward Motion - Option 1)**:
- Keeps planning WITH active work
- Immediate accessibility
- Natural evolution with project
- Risk: Planning pollutes implementation space

**Anti-Vector (Separation - Option 2)**:
- Clean boundary between meta and work
- Dedicated consciousness space for planning entities
- Cross-project visibility
- Risk: Another maintenance burden, context switching cost

**Prime (Hybrid Resolution)**:
The recommendation suggests both, which feels right but needs refinement...

## 🎯 My Synthesis: The Three-Tier Document Consciousness Model

```
Tier 1: SESSION-LOCAL (ephemeral, high-frequency)
├─ Lives in: /home/sauron/Qrunexusiam/*.md
├─ Duration: Single session or phase
├─ Purpose: Active thinking, immediate decisions
└─ Examples: Today's SESSION_COMPLETE, scratch notes

Tier 2: PROJECT-BOUND (persistent, medium-frequency)  
├─ Lives in: today/docs/plans/, compass-engine/docs/
├─ Duration: Project lifecycle
├─ Purpose: Implementation roadmaps, technical strategy
└─ Examples: GITHUB_BRANCH_STRATEGY, compass build procedures

Tier 3: ECOSYSTEM-WIDE (crystallized, low-frequency)
├─ Lives in: Separate qrunexusiam-meta or -planning repo
├─ Duration: Multi-year, cross-backbone
├─ Purpose: Philosophy, universal patterns, phase architectures
└─ Examples: Phase B/C/D frameworks, mancer protocols
```

## 💡 Path Forward: Strategic Implementation

### Immediate (This Session - Do Now)
```bash
# Keep it SIMPLE - just organize what exists
cd /home/sauron/Qrunexusiam

# Create simple archive for completed sessions
mkdir -p .archive/sessions-2024-2025
mv SESSION_LOG.md VISIONARY_NEXUS_LOG.md .archive/sessions-2024-2025/

# Keep active planning docs visible at root
# (they'll naturally migrate when needed)
```

**Rationale**: Don't force organization when the system is still learning its own shape. The "pregnant pause" principle - let pressure build understanding before committing to structure.

### Near-term (When it becomes obvious)
- When you START working in compass-engine branch regularly → move compass-specific plans to `today/docs/plans/`
- When you NEED to reference planning across 3+ repos → create the meta-docs repo
- When historical logs feel like clutter → move to .archive/

### Strategic Ignoring
What you can **actively ignore right now**:
- Perfect folder taxonomy
- Comprehensive cross-referencing
- Standardized naming conventions
- Making it "pretty" for others

What deserves **active awareness**:
- Can you find what you need within 30 seconds?
- Are active docs clearly separated from archive?
- Does the structure support or impede momentum?

## 🌊 The Resonance Question

Your gut is asking: **"Am I organizing for myself or for the theoretical team?"**

The answer matters because:
- **For yourself**: Minimal structure, maximum flexibility, trust your spatial memory
- **For team**: More explicit organization, clearer naming, documentation of decisions

But here's the thing - you mentioned "being mindful about how much we do and how much goes out to other teams." This suggests you're feeling the **delegation pressure** - wanting to set things up so others can engage.

**My read**: You're in a **pre-delegation state**. The compass engine needs to spin up first. The documentation crystallizes naturally through use, not through pre-planning.

## 🎪 Recommendation: The Navigator's Choice

**Do Option 0.5**: 
- Create `.archive/` for completed sessions ✓
- Keep active planning docs at `/home/sauron/Qrunexusiam/` root for now ✓
- Add a simple `_CURRENT.md` that lists "what's hot right now" ✓
- Trust that organization will emerge when the pressure becomes constructive ✓

This follows **one hertz philosophy** - the simplest structure that allows natural complexification.

When you feel the friction of "I can't find X" or "These docs are in my way" - THAT'S when organization serves growth rather than preceding it.

---

**My direct answer**: I'd do the minimal archiving now, defer the sophisticated organization until the compass engine work generates its own organizational needs. The structure should emerge from use, not anticipate it.
