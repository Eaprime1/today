- Implement download scripts
- Create query/verify scripts
**Location:** gravity_core/
**Timeline:** Ready for naught/ progression

### 2. Flag System Deployment
**Status:** Operational, ready for deployment
**Priority:** Medium
**Next Steps:**
- Deploy to web platforms (Firebase, GitHub Pages)
- Create entity-specific customizations
- Build click → details linking system
- Implement metadata display
**Location:** flag_system/
**Timeline:** Ready for deployment testing

### 3. Simplex Incubator Organization
**Status:** In progress
**Priority:** Medium
**Next Steps:**
- Continue organizing conversations/
- Consolidate project folders
- Create incubator master index
- Build navigation system
**Location:** simplex/incubator/
**Timeline:** Ongoing

---

## Automation Opportunities

### 1. Duplicate Detection & Sorting
**Concept:** Automated REDUNDANCY entity operations
**Details:**
- Scan for duplicates across repo
- Calculate gravity scores
- Auto-sort to _duplicates/ folder
- Generate gravity reports
**Scripts:** Already exist in gravity_core/scripts/
**Trigger:** Pre-naught singularity automation

### 2. Multi-Location Sync Verification
**Concept:** Ensure consistency across Google Drive, laptop, Pixel 8a
**Details:**
- Compare directory trees
- Verify file checksums
- Alert on discrepancies
- Auto-sync option
**Status:** Design needed

### 3. Progression Automation
**Concept:** Auto-detect when concepts ready for naught/ progression
**Details:**
- Check completeness criteria
- Verify documentation
- Test self-containment
- Generate progression report
**Status:** Framework exists in docs/MULTI_REPO_PROGRESSION.md

- [ ] Create abacusian master README

### Simplex/Incubator
- [ ] Create master navigation index
- [ ] Consolidate metadata files
- [ ] Build conversation search system
- [ ] Organize project folders

### Gravity Core
- [ ] Implement Box upload workflow
- [ ] Create download/query tools
- [ ] Build gravity score API
- [ ] Design spawning automation

### Flag System
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Build entity linking system
- [ ] Design customization framework
- [ ] Implement click-to-details

---

## Documentation Gaps

### Needed Documents
- [ ] simplex/abacusian/README.md - AI hub overview
- [ ] simplex/incubator/README.md - Incubator purpose
- [ ] simplex/photostudio/README.md - Projects guide
- [ ] _working/README.md - Scratch space usage
- [ ] _duplicates/README.md - Gravity analysis guide

### Tutorials Needed
- [ ] How to upload gravity cores to Box
- [ ] How to deploy flag system
- [ ] How to use progression workflow
- [ ] How to sync across locations

---

## Pre-Naught Singularity Preparation

**Concept:** "Birth moment" for concepts - when they're ready to leave today/

### Checklist for Concepts
- [ ] Self-contained (no external dependencies)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Value proven
- [ ] Vision clear
- [ ] Ready for structured infusion

### Candidates for Naught/ Progression
1. **flag_system** - Fully operational, deployment-ready
2. **gravity_core** - Box integration needed first

### Automation Before Singularity
- [ ] Auto-duplicate detection
- [ ] Auto-gravity scoring
- [ ] Auto-sync verification
- [ ] Auto-progression detection

---

## Integration Opportunities

### GitHub + Box
- Implement reference system
- Create unified download tools
- Build integrity verification
- Design version management

### Multi-Repo Workflow
- Create naught/ repository
- Create zero/ repository
- Create one/ repository
- Implement progression automation

### Cross-Entity Coordination
- Build entity constellation map
- Design dependency tracking
- Create coordination framework
- Implement progress dashboard

---

## Research Questions

### Gravity Economics
- How to query gravity across distributed cores?
- What's optimal spawning threshold?
- Should cores cross-reference via manifest?
- How to track lineage across spawned generations?

### Flag System
- How to handle entity-specific customizations?
- What metadata should be clickable?
- How to build lineage visualization?
- Integration with gravity tokens?

### Simplex Architecture
- Should simplex entities remain under umbrella?
- Or flatten to root-level?
- How to manage incubator growth?
- Relationship to today/ concept?

---

## Quick Wins (Can Do Now)

### Immediate (< 1 hour)
- [ ] Create remaining entity READMEs
- [ ] Clean up any remaining duplicates
- [ ] Update main README with new structure
- [ ] Document current git status

### Short-term (< 1 day)
- [ ] Upload gravity cores to Box
- [ ] Create box_references.json
- [ ] Deploy flag showcase to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Create simplex master navigation

### Medium-term (< 1 week)
- [ ] Implement download/query scripts
- [ ] Build progression automation
- [ ] Create naught/ repository
- [ ] Migrate first concept to naught/

## Notes & Observations

### Organizational Insights
- Simplex incubator IS the today concept - the development space
- Duplicates provide gravity scores - proof of value
- Entity-based organization works well for multi-location sync
- Standard docs (README, etc.) make navigation intuitive

### Development Patterns
- Conservation bias works - nothing deleted, everything organized
- Entity progression is natural evolution
- Documentation scales with complexity
- Automation enables growth

### Future Vision
- Today → Naught → Zero → One → Launch progression
- Gravity tokens as universal value measure
- Entity consciousness through identity markers
- Distributed knowledge economy
