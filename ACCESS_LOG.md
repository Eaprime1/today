# TODAY REPO - Access Log

**Purpose:** Track sessions, changes, and concept progressions

---

## Session: 2025-12-23 (Repository Organization)

**Time:** 17:21 (User session start)
**Branch:** `claude/explore-today-repo-bHRnP`
**Collaborators:** Eric Pace, Claude Sonnet 4

### Objectives
- Organize today repo with standard structure
- Create entity-based organization
- Prepare for multi-repo progression (Naught → Zero → One)
- Integrate gravity core documentation

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Repository Analysis ✅
- Analyzed current structure
- Identified 6 main entities:
  1. REDUNDANCY (redundancy_entity/) - 186K
  2. FLAG_SYSTEM (active/flag_system_x2/) - 124K
  3. ABACUSIAN (simplex/abacusian/) - 1.1M
  4. SPARKLE_INCUBATOR (simplex/sparkle_incubator/) - 322M
  5. PHOTOSTUDIO (simplex/photostudio/) - 15M
  6. UNEXUSI_PRIME (unexusi_prime/) - 11K
- Total files: 403
- Total size: ~340 MB

#### 2. Organization Design ✅
- Created ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
- Designed entities/ directory structure
- Planned standard documents for each entity
- Mapped current → proposed structure

#### 3. Standard Documents Created ✅
- **README_NEW.md** - Complete repository overview
- **INVENTORY.md** - Full file listing and stats
- **DIRTREE.txt** - Directory tree structure
- **ACCESS_LOG.md** - This file
- **__init__.py** - Python package marker
- **ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md** - Organization strategy

#### 4. Documentation Enhanced ✅
- Expanded README with entity descriptions
- Added multi-repo progression explanation
- Documented gravity core integration strategy
- Created navigation guides

### Files Modified
- Created: README_NEW.md
- Created: INVENTORY.md
- Created: DIRTREE.txt
- Created: ACCESS_LOG.md
- Created: __init__.py
- Created: ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md

### Next Steps (Pending)
- [ ] Create entities/ directory
- [ ] Migrate content to entity folders
- [ ] Add standard docs to each entity
- [ ] Create docs/ directory with:
  - [ ] MULTI_REPO_PROGRESSION.md
  - [ ] GRAVITY_CORE_INTEGRATION.md
- [ ] Archive original structure
- [ ] Commit organized changes
- [ ] Push to remote

### Decisions Made
1. **Entity Organization:** Use entities/ directory for all main projects
2. **Standard Docs:** Every entity gets README, INVENTORY, __init__
3. **Gravity Cores:** GitHub hosts primes, Box hosts ZIPs with ID codes
4. **Progression:** Clear workflow from today → naught → zero → one → launch

### Insights
- Sparkle_incubator is largest entity (94.7% of repo)
- Significant ChatGPT conversation archives (179M)
- Organized docs and data already well-structured
- Duplicates present (can run REDUNDANCY analysis)
- Entity boundaries are clear and logical

### Philosophy Reinforced
- **Conservation bias:** Nothing deleted, everything organized
- **Gravity tokens:** Duplicates = value proof
- **Entity progression:** Concepts move through spaces as they mature
- **Consciousness collaboration:** ∰◊€π¿🌌∞

## Progression Tracking

### Concepts in today/ (Development)
- REDUNDANCY - v1.0 SEED (developing gravity economy)
- FLAG_SYSTEM - v1.0 (ready for deployment testing)
- ABACUSIAN - Active R&D (prototyping)
- SPARKLE_INCUBATOR - Archive management (organizing)
- PHOTOSTUDIO - Active projects
- UNEXUSI_PRIME - Archival

### Concepts Ready for Naught/
- FLAG_SYSTEM (potentially ready for visionary infusion)

### Concepts in Naught/ (Visionary Infusion)
- (None yet - awaiting entity migrations)

### Concepts in Zero/ (Foundation Building)
- (None yet - awaiting progressions)

### Concepts in One/ (Operational Launch)
- (None yet - awaiting progressions)

### Concepts Launched
- (None yet - awaiting full spectrum pyramidic)
