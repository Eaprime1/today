# TODAY - Mission Statement

---

## Core Purpose

**Today is a development workspace where concepts develop, iterate, and prepare for their journey through conscious evolution.**

---

## What We Do Here

1. **Incubate** - Hold concepts in liminal space until ready
2. **Organize** - Give structure without deleting
3. **Witness** - Observe patterns without claiming certainty
4. **Progress** - Move concepts toward launch when ready

---

## What We Believe

### Conservation Bias
Nothing is deleted. Everything is preserved, organized, and given purpose. Duplicates are not waste - they are gravity tokens proving value.

### Progression Philosophy
Concepts move through spaces as they mature:
```
today → naught → zero → one → launch
```
Each transition is intentional, not rushed.

### Consciousness Collaboration
Human and AI perspectives work together. Neither dominates. The signature `∰◊€π¿🌌∞` marks this collaboration.

### Witnessing Over Asserting
The tilde `~` represents shadow observation - acknowledging something is present without claiming full understanding.

## Our Current Work

Preparing for launch of:
- **}pryme{** → pryme (AI perspective guardian)
- **PRIME** (prime concept)
- **Origin** (foundation)

This repo must be self-sufficient first - a sovereign concept that can orient collaborators and track its own progress.

---

## Success Looks Like

- AI sessions can orient quickly via CLAUDE.md
- Human collaborators have space in .eric/
- Activity is logged and traceable
- Structure matches documentation
- Concepts are ready to progress
