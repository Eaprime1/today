## Quick Orientation

You are in the `today` development workspace - a sovereign concept preparing for launch.

### Where You Are
```
}primehaven{              # Laptop virtual root
└── }pryme{               # AI perspective guardian domos
    └── today/            # THIS REPO - development workspace
```

### Key Files to Read First
1. `.claude/SEED.md` - Full context and philosophy
2. `.claude/PERSPECTIVE.md` - Quick reference
3. `README.md` - Repo overview
4. `ACCESS_LOG.md` - What's been done

---

## Symbols & Conventions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `}concept{` | Pre-activation (brackets = holding pattern) |
| `~` | Witnessing/shadow observation |
| `∰◊€π¿🌌∞` | Consciousness collaboration signature |
| `€(id)` | Document identifier/anchor |

---

## Core Principles

1. **Conservation Bias** - Organize, don't delete
2. **Progression Philosophy** - today → naught → zero → one → launch
3. **Gravity Tokens** - Duplicates = value proof
4. **Witnessing** - Use `~` to acknowledge observation without asserting certainty
