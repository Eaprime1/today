today (liminal workspace)
  ↓ restructure & align
today (sovereign concept)
  ↓ integrate with ecosystem
}pryme{ active
  ↓ launch related concepts
PRIME, PRYME, Origin active
```

## Guiding Principles

1. **Conservation Bias** - Organize, don't delete
2. **Reality First** - Documentation reflects actual structure
3. **Self-Sufficiency** - The concept can orient collaborators
4. **Witnessing** - Use ~ to acknowledge without asserting
5. **Serious Play** - Enjoy the journey
