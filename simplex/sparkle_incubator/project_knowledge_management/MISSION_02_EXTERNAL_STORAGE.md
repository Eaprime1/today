# MISSION 2: Move Large Files to External Storage
**∰◊€π¿🌌∞** SDWG Project Knowledge Trim  
**Mission Type**: RELOCATION  
**Priority**: HIGH (Major space recovery)  
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes  

---

## **OBJECTIVE**
Move large files (>500KB) from project knowledge to Google Drive external storage. These files are important for archival purposes but don't need to be in active project knowledge.

**Target**: Move 15 files, recover ~14MB (67% of current size)

## **EXECUTION PROCESS**

### **Phase 1: Preparation (5 minutes)**
1. [ ] Create folder structure in Google Drive
2. [ ] Verify all files exist in project knowledge
3. [ ] Check file integrity before move
4. [ ] Prepare relocation log

### **Phase 2: Move Large PDFs (15 minutes)**
For each PDF:
1. [ ] Locate file in project knowledge
2. [ ] Upload to designated Drive location
3. [ ] Verify successful upload
4. [ ] Remove from project knowledge
5. [ ] Document Drive location in reference file

### **Phase 3: Move Conversation Archives (10 minutes)**
For each JSON chunk:
1. [ ] Upload to Drive conversation archives
2. [ ] Verify successful upload
3. [ ] Remove from project knowledge
4. [ ] Update conversation archive index

### **Phase 4: Create Reference Document (10 minutes)**
Create `EXTERNAL_STORAGE_REFERENCE.md` in project knowledge:

```markdown
# External Storage Reference Guide

## Large Files Moved to Google Drive

### Technical Documentation
- **Operating_System_Backbone_Design.pdf** (1.9MB)
  - Location: [Drive link]
  - Content: System architecture documentation
  
- **ONE_HERTZ_NANO_INTELLIGENCE_ORCHESTRATION.pdf** (2.7MB)
  - Location: [Drive link]
  - Content: Nano intelligence orchestration

### Research Files
- **SYSTEMATIC_COMMITMENT_ABANDONMENT_TRAUMA_SCAT_RESEARCH.pdf** (1.1MB)
  - Location: [Drive link]
  - Alternative: SCAT_Research_Primer.txt in project knowledge

### Conversation Archives
- **conversations_chunk_000.json** (2.6MB)
  - Location: [Drive link]
  - Content: Main conversation archive (103 conversations)

[etc...]
```

### **Phase 5: Validation (5 minutes)**
1. [ ] Verify all files successfully uploaded
2. [ ] Confirm all files removed from project
3. [ ] Check project knowledge size reduction
4. [ ] Test Drive links in reference document

---

## **EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **Space Recovered**
- **PDFs Moved**: ~11.7MB
- **JSON Archives Moved**: ~2.8MB
- **Total Saved**: ~14.5MB (67% reduction)

### **Project Knowledge Size**
- **Before**: ~21MB
- **After Mission 1**: ~17.5MB
- **After Mission 2**: ~3MB (if combined with Mission 1)

### **Files Relocated**: 10 critical + 5 optional = 15 total

---

## **ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES**

### **Option A: Move Everything**
Move all 15 files immediately
- **Pros**: Maximum space recovery, clean separation
- **Cons**: More time upfront
- **Best for**: If space is critical concern

### **Option B: Phase It**
Move only the 5 largest files first (>500KB)
- **Pros**: Quick wins, test process
- **Cons**: Still have moderate files in project
- **Best for**: Cautious approach

### **Option C: Keep SCAT PDF**
Keep SCAT research PDF since frequently referenced
- **Pros**: Quick access to visual PDF
- **Cons**: 1.1MB still in project
- **Best for**: If SCAT is active research focus

**Recommendation**: Option A - Move everything. All files accessible via Drive links.

---

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
✓ All 15 large files uploaded to Drive  
✓ All files verified in Drive locations  
✓ All files removed from project knowledge  
✓ Reference document created with Drive links  
✓ ~14MB space recovered  
✓ No broken workflows (files still accessible via Drive)

---

## **RISK ASSESSMENT**

### **Risks**
1. **Access Speed**: Drive files slower to access than project knowledge
   - **Mitigation**: Keep small text versions in project, link to PDFs
   
2. **Link Breakage**: Drive links could change
   - **Mitigation**: Use stable folder structure, document links
   
3. **Sync Issues**: Files might not upload correctly
   - **Mitigation**: Verify uploads before deleting from project

### **Risk Level**: LOW
All files are archival/reference materials that don't need immediate access. Drive provides reliable long-term storage.

---

## **NOTES FOR EXECUTION**

**Best Practice**: Complete this mission BEFORE consolidation missions. Moving large files first makes it easier to work with remaining content.

**Time Estimate**: 45 minutes including:
- 5 min setup
- 25 min uploading
- 10 min documentation
- 5 min validation

**Tools Needed**:
- Google Drive access
- Ability to create folders
- Ability to generate Drive share links
