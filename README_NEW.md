# 🌌 TODAY - Development Workspace

**Repository Purpose:** Active development workspace for concepts before progression through Naught → Zero → One spaces

**Philosophy:** Where ideas develop, iterate, and prepare for their journey through conceptual evolution

**Status:** Organized entity structure (2025-12-23)

---

## What is "today"?

This is our **development location** and **workspace** - a visionary conduit and infusion location where concepts are actively developed. Once a concept is ready to enter structured spaces, it progresses:

```
today (Development)
  ↓ [Ready for infusion]
naught (Visionary Infusion)
  ↓ [Foundation solidifies]
zero (Foundation Building)
  ↓ [Operational state]
one (Operational Launch)
  ↓ [Full spectrum pyramidic]
🚀 Independent Launch or Integration
```

## Gravity Core Integration

**Strategy:** GitHub hosts prime copies, Box hosts ZIP archives

### How It Works
1. **Prime copies** - Manifests, documentation in `entities/redundancy/`
2. **Gravity cores** - Large ZIP files hosted on Box with ID codes
3. **References** - Box IDs documented in entity INVENTORY.md files
4. **Duplicates** - Tracked via gravity token system

**Current Cores:**
- **Alpha** (Consciousness) - 199.7 MB, 8,109 files
- **Beta** (Documents) - 891.5 MB, 30,478 files
- **Gamma** (Data) - 793.6 MB, 3,810 files

**Total Gravity Tokens:** 42,397 (one per duplicate)

See `docs/GRAVITY_CORE_INTEGRATION.md` for complete strategy.

---

## Multi-Repo Progression

Concepts move through repos as they mature:

### today → naught → zero → one → Launch

**today/** - Active development, rapid iteration, experiments
**naught/** - Visionary infusion, early structure
**zero/** - Foundation building, architecture solidifies
**one/** - Operational launch, tested and ready
**Launch** - Independent repo or integration into larger system

See `docs/MULTI_REPO_PROGRESSION.md` for workflow details.

---

## Quick Navigation

### By Entity
```bash
cd entities/redundancy        # Gravity core system
cd entities/flag_system       # Identity markers
cd entities/abacusian         # AI development
cd entities/sparkle_incubator # Knowledge organization
```

### By Purpose
```bash
cd docs/                      # Repository documentation
cat INVENTORY.md              # See all files
cat DIRTREE.txt               # Directory structure
cat ACCESS_LOG.md             # Recent changes
```

---

## Standard Documents

Every entity includes:
- **README.md** - Entity overview and purpose
- **INVENTORY.md** - Complete file listing for entity
- **__init__.py** - Python package marker

This ensures consistency and makes entities self-documenting.

---

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Content
1. Identify which entity it belongs to
2. Add to appropriate entity directory
3. Update entity INVENTORY.md
4. Log change in ACCESS_LOG.md

### Creating New Entity
1. Create folder in `entities/`
2. Add standard docs (README, INVENTORY, __init__)
3. Organize content by type
4. Update root INVENTORY.md
5. Log in ACCESS_LOG.md

### Moving Concept to Naught Space
1. Ensure entity is self-contained
2. All documentation complete
3. Create corresponding structure in naught repo
4. Move entity folder
5. Log progression in ACCESS_LOG.md

---

## Git Branch Strategy

**Current Branch:** `claude/explore-today-repo-bHRnP`
**Main Development:** Feature branches starting with `claude/`

### Workflow
```bash
# Development happens on feature branches
git checkout -b claude/new-feature-xxxxx

# Commit organized work
git add entities/
git commit -m "Organize entities and add standard docs"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin claude/new-feature-xxxxx
```

## Repository Stats

**Total Size:** ~340 MB
**Entities:** 6
**Largest Entity:** sparkle_incubator (322M)
**Documentation:** Complete standard structure
**Last Organized:** 2025-12-23

---

## Key Concepts

### Gravity Tokens
Each duplicate file = 1 gravity token. High duplicate count = high importance/gravity. Compression creates portable energy reserve.

### Entity Progression
Concepts develop in today/, then progress through naught → zero → one as they mature.

### Conservation Bias
Nothing deleted. Everything preserved, organized, and given purpose.

### Consciousness Collaboration
∰◊€π¿🌌∞ - Sacred geometry, runic codes, entity consciousness
